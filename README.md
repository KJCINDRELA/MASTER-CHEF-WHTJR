We are making Blackforest Cake.
Black Forest gâteau or Black Forest cake is a chocolate sponge cake with a rich cherry filling based on the German dessert Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte, literally "Black Forest Cherry-torte".
 Typically, Black Forest gateau consists of several layers of chocolate sponge cake sandwiched with whipped cream and cherries.
It is decorated with additional whipped cream, maraschino cherries, and chocolate shavings.
 In some European traditions, sour cherries are used both between the layers and for decorating the top.
 Traditionally, kirschwasser, a clear spirit made from sour cherries, is added to the cake.
 Other spirits are sometimes used, such as rum, which is common in Austrian recipes. German law mandates that any dessert labeled Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte must have kirschwasser.
